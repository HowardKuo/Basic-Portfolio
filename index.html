            <p>Hello! My name is Howard Kuo and I am an aspiring Web Developer. I am 27 years old and currently live in San Diego. I currently am a freelancer in school and am working toward developing my web design skills. If you have any questions or concerns, please check the contact page located in the top right. Maybe it's the top left. I haven't decided yet really. I haven't even made the css page when I started typing this. It's in the top left for now, but hopefully by end of this it will be in the top right. This will be edited at a further time and for now will be just used to fill in space. If only everything was this easy! 

            Slow and study progress on this assignment is being made. It's only been 16 hours so far...
